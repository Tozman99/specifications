# Simple clock implementation : 
Expl : A digital clock that change states (= increments by 1 if a condition is true ) 

init state : 
	Let's define HCini has the initial state of the clock 

Next state : 
	Let's define HCnxt has the next state of the clock 

1) the formula assert that the initial state is HCini 
2) its steps (HCnxt or the next state) satisfies HCnxt
